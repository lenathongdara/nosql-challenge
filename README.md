# Module 12 Challenge

## NoSQL Database Challenge

Submitted by: Lena Thongdara

In the initial phase of this challenge (Part 1), we initiated our database setup and fine-tuned our Jupyter Notebook. This involved the seamless importation of our JSON resource file into MongoDB.

Advancing to Part 2, we enriched our database by introducing a new restaurant and efficiently purging establishments that did not align with our interests. Additionally, we executed a conversion process, transforming multiple fields into numeric formats.

Concluding with Part 3, our focus shifted towards exploratory analysis. Through an array of carefully crafted queries, we delved into the dataset, unraveling valuable insights. These insights not only enhanced our understanding of the data but also empowered us to address specific inquiries related to establishments and their respective ratings.
